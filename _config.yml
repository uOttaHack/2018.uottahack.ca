It will be examining both asymmetric and symmetric schemes used in network communication protocols and general data protection. Even if attendees may not be interacting directly with cryptographic libraries, knowledge of the subject can be applied to the configuration of services using such libraries (e.g web-servers, load-balancers etc). An example open source library will be presented for demonstration using reference code. <br/><br/> In order to take advantage of the example code, students are suggested to have a laptop with access to a dev environment in Linux ( CentOS/Ubuntu ) with build essentials, git and optionally eclipse-cdt. Access to the internet is required"

        Any student, at any skill level, from any field of study are welcome!

    - question: "> Can I work on a project I've already started?"
      answer: >
        All projects must be started from scratch at the event, but you're free to start thinking up an idea for one!
    - question: "> Can I participate as part of a group?"
      answer: >
        **Yes!**   Hacking can be done solo, or in a team of up to four participants.
    - question: "> How much will it cost me?"
      answer: >
        **Nothing at all!** Attending the hackathon is completely free, including any meals during the hackathon. We will also provide as much hype as you can possibly imagine.
    - question: "> What if I'm not from Ottawa?"
      answer: >
        We'd love to have you in the world's coldest capital! We'll be sending buses to areas where lots of hackers are coming from (Montreal, Waterloo, Toronto, etc.) as well as travel reimbursements. However, travel reimbursements are granted on a case by case basis, and we cannot guarantee them for all participants.  More info will be available closer to the hackathon!
    - question: "> Are newbie programmers and hackers allowed?"
      answer: >
        Of course! Hackathons are all about learning new things and having an amazing experience. We'll have plenty of workshops and mentors during the event to help you out!
    - question: "> Can high school students come?"
      answer: >
        **Yes!** We highly encourage younger high school students to apply and come get creative! Minors attending will be asked to have waivers signed by their parents/ guardians.
    - question: "> I think I'd rather help others learn instead of making my own hack - can I still come?"
      answer: >
        **Yes!**  We are currently accepting applications for <b>volunteers</b> and <b>mentors</b>.  We are seeking mentors who are experienced in hacking or programming to assist with workshops, and to mentor hackers who have questions or who run into difficulties throughout the hackathon.  Please apply using the button above. <br> <br> <b> Not experienced in programming or mentoring, but still want to help out?</b> No problem - we'd love to have you on board as a volunteer to help out with other aspects of uOttaHack!  You can apply using the same button!
    - question: "> Sounds great, but what do I win?"
      answer: >
        We started uOttaHack to empower students in creating innovative, fun, and awesome projects, without the stress of a regular semester's weekend. The biggest reward you will get are the friends you make that last a lifetime, and an experience you won't forget. <br> <br> <b> But, with that said - </b> you'll have the chance to demo to our stellar panel of judges, and the top teams will be rewarded with some sweet prizes! There will also be smaller prizes for specific categories and potentially some given out by our sponsors!
    - question: "> What is Major League Hacking?"
